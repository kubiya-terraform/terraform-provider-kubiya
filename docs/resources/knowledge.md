# kubiya_knowledge (Resource)

The `kubiya_knowledge` resource allows you to create and manage knowledge resources in the Kubiya platform. Knowledge resources provide specific information, documentation, and context that agents can reference when performing tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before using this resource, ensure you have:
1. A Kubiya account with API access
2. An API key (generated from Kubiya dashboard under Admin â†’ Kubiya API Keys)
3. At least one group configured in your Kubiya organization
4. Content files prepared (markdown, text, or other formats)

## Example Usage

### 1. Basic Knowledge Resource

Create a simple knowledge resource:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kubiya = {
      source = "kubiya-terraform/kubiya"
    }
  }
}

provider "kubiya" {
  # API key is automatically read from KUBIYA_API_KEY environment variable
}

resource "kubiya_knowledge" "basic_docs" {
  name        = "basic-documentation"
  description = "Basic system documentation"
  content     = "This is the basic documentation for our system."
  format      = "markdown"
  
  # Groups are required
  groups = ["Engineering"]
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates a basic knowledge resource accessible to the Engineering group.

### 2. Deployment Procedures

Store deployment procedures documentation:

```hcl
resource "kubiya_knowledge" "deployment_guide" {
  name        = "deployment-procedures"
  description = "Standard procedures for application deployment"
  content     = file("${path.module}/docs/deployment-guide.md")
  format      = "markdown"
  
  groups = ["DevOps", "Engineering"]
  
  labels = ["deployment", "procedures", "documentation"]
}

resource "kubiya_agent" "deployment_assistant" {
  name         = "deployment-assistant"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "Deployment assistance agent"
  instructions = <<-EOT
    You are a deployment assistant with access to deployment procedures.
    Reference the deployment-procedures knowledge base for standard procedures.
    Always follow the documented deployment steps.
  EOT
  
  groups = ["DevOps"]
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates deployment documentation that agents can reference during deployments.

### 3. Architecture Documentation

Store system architecture documentation:

```hcl
resource "kubiya_knowledge" "architecture" {
  name        = "system-architecture"
  description = "System architecture diagrams and explanations"
  content     = <<-MARKDOWN
    # System Architecture
    
    ## Overview
    Our system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:
    
    ### Frontend Layer
    - React application
    - Nginx reverse proxy
    - CloudFront CDN
    
    ### API Layer
    - REST API Gateway
    - GraphQL endpoint
    - WebSocket server
    
    ### Backend Services
    - User Service
    - Order Service
    - Payment Service
    - Notification Service
    
    ### Data Layer
    - PostgreSQL (primary database)
    - Redis (caching)
    - Elasticsearch (search)
    - S3 (object storage)
    
    ## Communication Patterns
    - Synchronous: REST/GraphQL
    - Asynchronous: RabbitMQ/Kafka
    - Real-time: WebSockets
    
    ## Security
    - JWT authentication
    - API rate limiting
    - WAF protection
  MARKDOWN
  format = "markdown"
  
  groups = ["Engineering", "DevOps", "Product", "Security"]
  
  labels = ["architecture", "documentation", "system-design", "technical"]
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates comprehensive architecture documentation accessible to multiple teams.

### 4. Troubleshooting Runbooks

Create troubleshooting runbooks:

```hcl
resource "kubiya_knowledge" "troubleshooting" {
  name        = "troubleshooting-runbooks"
  description = "Runbooks for common issues and their resolution"
  content     = <<-MARKDOWN
    # Troubleshooting Runbooks
    
    ## High Memory Usage
    
    ### Symptoms
    - Memory usage above 90%
    - Application slowness
    - OOM kills
    
    ### Diagnosis Steps
    1. Check memory usage: `free -m`
    2. Identify top consumers: `ps aux --sort=-%mem | head`
    3. Check for memory leaks: `jmap -heap <pid>`
    
    ### Resolution
    1. Restart affected services
    2. Scale horizontally if needed
    3. Investigate code for memory leaks
    
    ## Database Connection Issues
    
    ### Symptoms
    - Connection timeout errors
    - "Too many connections" errors
    
    ### Diagnosis Steps
    1. Check connection count: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;`
    2. Check for long-running queries
    3. Verify network connectivity
    
    ### Resolution
    1. Kill idle connections
    2. Increase connection pool size
    3. Optimize queries
  MARKDOWN
  format = "markdown"
  
  groups = ["DevOps", "SRE", "Engineering"]
  
  labels = ["troubleshooting", "runbooks", "operations", "incident-response"]
}

resource "kubiya_agent" "incident_responder" {
  name         = "incident-responder"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "Incident response agent"
  instructions = <<-EOT
    You are an incident response agent. 
    Use the troubleshooting-runbooks knowledge base to diagnose and resolve issues.
    Follow the documented procedures exactly.
  EOT
  
  groups = ["DevOps", "SRE"]
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates runbooks that agents can follow during incident response.

### 5. API Documentation

```hcl
resource "kubiya_knowledge" "api_docs" {
  name        = "api-documentation"
  description = "REST API documentation and examples"
  content     = <<-MARKDOWN
    # API Documentation
    
    ## Authentication
    All API requests require a Bearer token:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ```
    
    ## Endpoints

  labels = [each.key, "environment", "documentation", "guide"]
}

resource "kubiya_agent" "env_assistants" {
  for_each = local.environments
  
  name         = "${each.key}-assistant"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "Assistant for ${each.key} environment"
  instructions = "You are an assistant for the ${each.key} environment. Reference the ${each.value.name} knowledge base."
  
  groups = each.value.groups
}
