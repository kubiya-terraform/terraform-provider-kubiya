# kubiya_external_knowledge (Resource)

The `kubiya_external_knowledge` resource manages external knowledge integrations in the Kubiya platform. This resource allows you to connect external systems to the Kubiya RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system through a vendor-agnostic interface, enabling agents to access and learn from external data sources.

## Prerequisites

Before using this resource, ensure you have:
1. A Kubiya account with API access
2. An API key (generated from Kubiya dashboard under Admin â†’ Kubiya API Keys)
3. Access to the external system you want to integrate (e.g., Slack workspace)
4. Appropriate permissions in the external system

## Example Usage

### 1. Basic Slack Integration

Connect a single Slack channel:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kubiya = {
      source = "kubiya-terraform/kubiya"
    }
  }
}

provider "kubiya" {
  # API key is automatically read from KUBIYA_API_KEY environment variable
}

resource "kubiya_external_knowledge" "slack_general" {
  vendor = "slack"
  config = {
    channel_ids = ["C1234567890"]  # General channel ID
  }
}

resource "kubiya_agent" "slack_aware_agent" {
  name         = "slack-aware-assistant"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "Agent with access to Slack knowledge"
  instructions = "You have access to historical Slack conversations. Reference relevant discussions when answering questions."
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates an integration that allows agents to access knowledge from the specified Slack channel.

### 2. Multiple Slack Channels

Connect multiple Slack channels for broader knowledge access:

```hcl
resource "kubiya_external_knowledge" "slack_multi" {
  vendor = "slack"
  config = {
    channel_ids = [
      "C1234567890",  # #general
      "C0987654321",  # #engineering
      "C1111111111",  # #product
      "C2222222222"   # #support
    ]
  }
}

resource "kubiya_agent" "knowledge_agent" {
  name         = "knowledge-assistant"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "Agent with broad organizational knowledge"
  instructions = <<-EOT
    You have access to conversations from multiple Slack channels.
    Use this knowledge to:
    - Answer questions about past discussions
    - Provide context on decisions made
