# kubiya_agent (Resource)

The `kubiya_agent` resource allows you to create and manage AI agents in the Kubiya platform. Agents are intelligent assistants that can perform various tasks, integrate with external systems, and execute workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before using this resource, ensure you have:
1. A Kubiya account with API access
2. An API key (generated from Kubiya dashboard under Admin â†’ Kubiya API Keys)
3. At least one runner configured (or use "kubiya-hosted" for cloud execution)

## Example Usage

### 1. Basic Agent Configuration

This example creates a simple agent with minimal configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kubiya = {
      source = "kubiya-terraform/kubiya"
    }
  }
}

provider "kubiya" {
  # API key will be taken from KUBIYA_API_KEY environment variable
}

resource "kubiya_agent" "basic_agent" {
  name         = "my-basic-agent"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "A basic AI assistant for general tasks"
  instructions = "You are a helpful AI assistant. Provide clear and concise responses to user queries."
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates a basic AI agent accessible to all users in your organization.

### 2. Agent with User and Group Access Control

Configure an agent with specific user and group permissions:

```hcl
resource "kubiya_agent" "team_agent" {
  name         = "team-assistant"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "Team collaboration assistant"
  instructions = "You are a team assistant helping with project management and collaboration tasks."
  
  # Access control
  users  = ["alice@company.com", "bob@company.com"]
  groups = ["Engineering", "DevOps"]
  
  # Optional: Use a specific AI model
  model = "gpt-4o"
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates an agent accessible only to specified users and groups.

### 3. DevOps Agent with Integrations

Create an agent with access to external integrations:

```hcl
resource "kubiya_agent" "devops_agent" {
  name         = "devops-assistant"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "DevOps automation assistant"
  instructions = <<-EOT
    You are a DevOps assistant specialized in:
    - Managing Kubernetes clusters
    - GitHub repository operations
    - Slack notifications
    - JIRA ticket management
    
    Always confirm before making changes to production systems.
  EOT
  
  integrations = [
    "github_app",
    "slack_integration",
    "jira_cloud",
    "kubernetes"
  ]
  
  # Environment variables for the agent
  environment_variables = {
    DEFAULT_NAMESPACE = "production"
    ALERT_CHANNEL     = "#devops-alerts"
  }
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates a DevOps agent with access to multiple integrations and custom environment variables.

### 4. Agent with Predefined Tasks

Define an agent with specific tasks that users can execute:

```hcl
resource "kubiya_agent" "ops_agent" {
  name         = "operations-agent"
  runner       = "kubiya-hosted"
  description  = "Operations management agent"
  instructions = "You are an operations agent that helps with infrastructure management tasks."
  
  tasks = [
    {
      name        = "check-cluster-health"
      prompt      = "Check the health status of all Kubernetes clusters and report any issues"
      description = "Performs comprehensive health checks on K8s clusters"
    },
    {
      name        = "scale-deployment"
      prompt      = "Scale the specified deployment to the requested number of replicas"
      description = "Scales Kubernetes deployments"
    },
    {
      name        = "backup-database"
      prompt      = "Create a backup of the specified database and store it in S3"
      description = "Performs database backup operations"
    }
  ]
  
  integrations = ["kubernetes", "aws"]
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Creates an agent with predefined tasks that users can easily trigger.

## Best Practices

1. **Security**: Store sensitive information in secrets, not in environment variables
2. **Access Control**: Use groups for team-based access rather than individual users
3. **Instructions**: Be specific and clear in agent instructions to ensure consistent behavior
4. **Testing**: Test agents in a non-production runner before deploying to production
5. **Version Control**: Store your Terraform configurations in version control
6. **Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate the agent's purpose
7. **Documentation**: Include comments in your Terraform code explaining complex configurations
